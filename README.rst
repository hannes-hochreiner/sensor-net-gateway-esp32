SensorNet Gateway ESP32
=======================

I recently started working with the ESP32S2 and thought it might be fun to create a gateway to translate between ESP-NOW and USB.
The aim is to investigate whether sensors based on the ESP32S2 using ESP-NOW might be a good addition to my existing sensor network based on 434 MHz LoRa.
